#   config include 'sentinel_firewall'

#		option path '/usr/libexec/sentinel/firewall.sh'
#		option family 'any'
#		option reload '1'


# Make sure that we are last config.
# We have to be last config to ensure that we can reliably insert general block
# rules for dynamic firewall and other hacks.
# This is not ideal as we won't apply it in this run but rather by subsequent one
# but that is enough to ensure that we are last in the end.
